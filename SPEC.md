# Yulvon Language Specification

## Overview
Yulvon is a high-performance, statically-typed, compiled programming language designed for systems, real-time, and concurrent applications. It features zero-cost abstractions, deterministic memory, async/await, FFI, macros, and a production-grade toolchain.

---

## 1. Syntax & Semantics
- Minimalist, expressive syntax inspired by Rust, Go, and Zig
- Optional semicolon-less syntax (intelligent line breaks)
- Explicit control flow, no hidden behavior
- Example:

```yulvon
fn main() {
    let x = 42;
    print(x);
}
```

---

## 2. Types & Type System
- Static typing with type inference and type hints
- Built-in types: int, float, bool, string, array, struct
- User-defined types: struct, enum
- Example:

```yulvon
struct Vec2 { x: float, y: float }
let v = Vec2 { x: 1.0, y: 2.0 };
```

---

## 3. Memory Management
- No garbage collector; deterministic memory via ownership/borrowing
- Manual alloc/free with safe defaults
- Stack-first allocation for speed
- Full control over layout & alignment

---

## 4. Functions & Control Flow
- Functions: `fn name(params) { ... }`
- Async functions: `async fn name(params) { ... }`
- Return values: `fn add(a: int, b: int) -> int { ... }`
- Control flow: if, else, while, for, match

---

## 5. Concurrency & Parallelism
- Built-in async/await
- Native fibers/green threads
- Deterministic, real-time safe scheduler for game/RT use
- Message passing, lock-free atomics, wait-free queues
- Example:

```yulvon
async fn worker() { ... }
spawn(worker());
await(worker());
```

---

## 6. Macros & Compile-Time
- Powerful macro system: `macro name(params) { ... }`
- Macro invocation: `invoke name(args);`
- Compile-time code execution and DSL embedding

---

## 7. FFI & Interoperability
- Extern functions: `extern fn c_func(a: int) -> int`
- Auto-generated bindings from C headers
- Native WASM and static binary output

---

## 8. Error Handling & Safety
- Result/Option types, no exceptions
- Compile-time checks for unsafe ops
- Capability-based security
- Panic-free mode in release builds

---

## 9. Toolchain & Productivity
- Package manager (yulpm)
- Built-in benchmarking, profiling, and unit tests
- Hot code reload for live systems
- AI-powered compiler hints and optimization suggestions

---

## 10. Branding & Style
- Official logo and color theme in `/assets`
- Consistent, modern developer experience

---

## 11. Example Program
```yulvon
extern fn c_add(a: int, b: int) -> int

macro twice(x) {
    let y = x + x;
    print(y);
}

fn main() {
    let result = c_add(2, 3);
    invoke twice(result);
}
```
