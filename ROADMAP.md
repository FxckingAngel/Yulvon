# Yulvon Language Feature Checklist

## ⚙️ Compiler & Performance Core
- [x] Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compiler with native machine code output
- [x] Whole-program optimization and link-time optimization (LTO)
- [x] Optional Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler for fast prototyping
- [x] Zero-cost abstractions — high-level code compiles to low-level speed
- [x] Compiler hints for inlining, unrolling, vectorization

## 🧠 Runtime & Memory Management
- [x] No garbage collector — deterministic memory (ownership/borrowing)
- [x] Manual memory control (alloc/free) with safe default patterns
- [x] Stack-first allocation strategy for speed
- [x] Lock-free, wait-free algorithm support with atomics
- [x] Full control over memory layout & alignment

## ⚡ Concurrency & Parallelism
- [x] Built-in async/await with zero-cost abstraction
- [x] Native fibers / green threads for lightweight concurrency
- [x] First-class multi-core data parallelism primitives
- [x] Explicit scheduling model — control over how tasks run
- [x] Low-latency, race-free channel/message passing system

## 🔤 Syntax & Semantics
- [x] Minimalist, expressive syntax (inspired by Rust/Go/Zig)
- [x] Optional semicolon-less syntax with intelligent line breaks
- [x] Predictable, explicit control flow — no hidden behavior
- [x] Built-in primitives for SIMD, vector math, and low-level ops
- [x] Optional strict typing with type inference and type hints

## 🔗 Interoperability & Embedding
- [x] Zero-cost FFI with C, C++, ASM
- [x] Auto-generate bindings for external libraries
- [x] Native WASM compilation target for web/embedded use
- [x] Portable binary model for static linking

## 🧰 Developer Productivity
- [x] Built-in benchmarking/profiling macros
- [x] Powerful macro system and compile-time code execution
- [x] Custom DSL embedding support
- [x] Unit tests & benchmarks embedded in source files
- [x] Optional strict mode for performance-critical builds

## ⚠️ Error Handling & Safety
- [x] Result/Option-style error types (no exceptions)
- [x] Compile-time checks for unsafe ops
- [x] Capability-based security model for safe system-level code
- [x] Panic-free mode in release builds

## 🧙 Bonus/Advanced Ideas
- [x] Package manager with zero-install binary linking
- [x] Cross-compilation support out of the box
- [x] AI-powered compiler hints or optimization suggestions
- [x] Hot code reload for live systems
- [x] Game-engine friendly (real-time safe, deterministic scheduling)

## 🔰 Branding, Syntax & Design Options (optional next steps)
- [x] Design unique syntax & grammar (e.g. let, fn, =>, etc.)
- [x] Write sample programs (Hello World, Fibonacci, async web server)
- [x] Design logo & color theme for Yulvon
- [x] Write Yulvon spec/docs or publish a dev blog
- [ ] Launch site or GitHub for open-source build
